-----------------------------------HW 8----------------------------------------

1. a. The network is still secure because when the bytes are going across the
network they have already been encryted on your computer. They are encrypted
with public keys and can only be decrypted with private keys that no random
observer would access to without computing power that has not been invented
yet.

b. With access to keystrokes, the data could be corrupted and the network
would be insecure, because they would have access to the unencrypted message
that you originally typed out. They would also be able to determine the
passcode for the private key. If they had access to the computer then they
could enter the passcode and access files.

c. If the team had physical control of the USB at any time, no matter how long
they had it, they could access the .ssh folder and private key and decrypt all
information and/or bytes going across the network.

2. The gpg2 --verify command does not actually verify if the network is secure
because all it does is check if the target file and detached signatures match.
A third party attacker could intercept a message, and change both the message
signature file, which would confuse the gpg2 --verify command. This could be
fixed by posting your public key on a trusted online source that tracks
anyone who asks to use your public key and you could monitor and deny access
to any strangers.
