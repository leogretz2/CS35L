------------------Lab 8----------------------
First, I followed the Piazza post to I set up my Beagle Bone and connected it to wifi:

open PuTTY
root
connmanctl
connmanctl > enable wifi
connmanctl > scan wifi
connmanctl > services
connmanctl > agent on
connmanctl > connect wifi_506583d4fc5e_544e434150413937414239_managed_psk
connmanctl > quit

This connected me to the Room wifi. Then I updated the necessary packages
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install xauth
sudo apt-get install xvfb
sudo apt-get install firefox-esr-l10n-en-gb

I then enabled XForwarding in the specific files with
sudo vim /etc/ssh/ssh_config
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

I then installed the OpenSSH files:

sudo apt-get install openssh-server
sudo apt-get install openssh-client

Lastly, I installed XMing, restarted PuTTY and enabled X11 Forwarding.
With the Beagle Bone ready, I worked with Evan Wang

I made the password for my public/private RSA key pairs with:

ssh-keygen

I saved it in the default file: ~/.ssh/id_rsa my pressing enter and entered the
password 'piece' twice to confirm it. 

I acted as the client first and added my public key to Evan's server which was at IP address 10.97.85.178:

ssh-copy-id -i other@10.97.85.178

At this point, I typed it Evan's public password. Then I ssh'd in with the X option onto his host that allows port forwarding:

ssh -X other@10.97.85.178

Once I was in his Beagle Bone, I ran the firefox command and a firefox window popped up, showing success. I used the exit command to exit.

Then, I was server, where I added Evan's profile on my server and set the password:

sudo useradd -d /home/leo -m leo
sudo passwd leo

Then I changed into that directory and created an .ssh.

cd /home/leo/
sudo mkdir .ssh

Lastly, I changed the ownership settings with chown and chmod:

sudo chown -R leo .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

I found my IP address with the 'ifconfig' command, which allowed Evan to ssh into my Beagle Bone as the client.



and started by using the following commands and also set the password:

sudo useradd -d /home/leo -m leo
sudo passwd leo
