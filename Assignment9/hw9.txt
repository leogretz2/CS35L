1. I made another clone of the diffutils repository

git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git

2. Check out and create branch called quote based off of
diffutils version 3.0:

cd diffutils
git checkout v3.0 -b quote

3. Patch the patch file into new branch

patch -p1 < ../quote-3.0-patch.txt

4. I learned the C-x 4 a command to write a log entry

5. I entered emacs and made a changelog entry based on
the original log:

emacs
C-x 4 a

entered:

 * maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this' in diffutils 3.0

    This is in response to a recent change in the GNU coding standards,
    which now suggest quoting 'like this' or "like this", instead of
    `like this' or ``like this''.
        * src/cmp.c (try_help, specify_ignore_initial, usage, main):
        * src/diff.c (main, try_help, option_help_msgid, specify_value)
        (compare_files):
        * src/diff3.c (main, try_help, option_help_msgid, usage)
        (read_diff):
        * src/dir.c (compare_names):
        * src/sdiff.c (try_help, usage, check_child_status, main):
        * src/util.c (finish_output):
    Quote 'like this' or "like this" in commentary.

6. Commit files with changelog as the commit message:

git add .
git commit -F ChangeLog

7. Format the patch to be emailed out:

git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

8. Make a new branch for my partner (Nishanth Yeddula), get his formatted patch and
test if his works:

git checkout -b partner v3.0

git am < ../partner-patch.txt

./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check

9. To check if miy own patch works, make the whole thing, then cd into the
directory made and check the changelog:

make distdir
cd diffutils-3.0.2-be79-dirty
emacs ChangeLog

This displays the entire ChangeLog including my most recent addition at the top

10. I used these commands to enter eggert's emacs folder to open the merge window:

export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH
cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
gitk

This opened the merge window in xming, where I scrolled through the commit's and 
found the last merge on 2015-01-25:

Merge branch 'master' into xwidget
Author and Committer: Joakim Verona <joakim@verona.se>
2015-01-25 12:19:27

The window that opens displays all of the commits in the top bar, and then in the
bottom left, there is a display of the selected commit and in the right bottom
section, there is a list of comments for each commit/merge.
