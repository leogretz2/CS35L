1. I started the lab by getting the compressed tarball, the signature and the GNU
keyring with the following commands:

wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg 


When I ran this command:
gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
everything went smoothly until I got this WARNING:

 WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.

Essentially, this warning occurs because this is a public file and there is no way
to ensure that the signature that I ran belongs to the owner.


2. First, I unzipped the tarball and made a temporary directory to put the file in:
tar â€“xJvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
mkdir ~/coreutilsInstall

I switched to the directory that the coreutils was downloaded into: cd coreutils-8.29,
read the install page: emacs INSTALL

- then to configure the file into the directory I made
./configure --prefix=/u/eng/class/classlgr/coreutilsInstall
- then to compile it and install it: make, then make install


3. To reproduce the bug in the old coreutils, switch into my directory's bin:
cd ../coreutilsInstall/bin
Then run the command: ./ls -a -A

- This prints out . and .. (included in all the other files), displaying the bug


4. To perform the patch, I copied the patch page online, then switched into the 
coreutils-8.29 directory, made an diff file with the patch and then ran the patch file:

cd coreutils-8.29
emacs patch.diff
patch -p1 < patch.diff

When I ran the patch command, I received an error message that Hunk #1 failed at 4,
which means that this was where the patch file differed from the original. The patch
was successful other than that.


5. To reinstall the coreutils-8.29 with the patch, I used four commands. First to make
the directory, which gave me an automake error, at which point I reconfigured the
files that needed to be reconfigured. I then used make and again and installed it into
coreutils-8.29:

make
autoreconf --force --install
make


6. To test that the patched worked, I switched back into my temporary directory and ran
the ls command:

cd ~/coreutilsInstall/bin
./ls -aA

This printed out the list of the files and directories in the directory without . and ..
Proving that the patch worked!
